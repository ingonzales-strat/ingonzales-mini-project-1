# ingonzales-mini-project-1

Hello! Niko here~

This is the repository for my one and only portfolio site. It contains most, if not all of the projects and research I have done in my endeavors as a software developer. You can visit the deployed site on link shown on the sidebar of this repository.

My site was made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)  bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It used TailwindCSS as well as a variety of components from shadcn/ui and Tabler for icons. The site is deployed from Vercel

All of images I used (besides company logos) are one's I took. 

## Future Shenanigans
I plan to add a gallery page to show some of the photo's I'm rather proud of so to the people who find this repository I hope you check those out too.
